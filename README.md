# Conway's Game of Life

## Motivation

This project is just for fun.
I wanted to try to implement the game of life.

## Rules

The Rules of the game of life are stated [here](https://playgameoflife.com/info).
There are currently (09.04.2025) 4 rules:

1. Each cell with one or no neighbors **dies**.
2. Each cell with four or more neighbors **dies**.
3. Each cell with two or three neighbors **survives**.
4. Each cell with three neighbors becomes **populated**.
